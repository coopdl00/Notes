<h2 id="git">Git</h2>
<p>Hard Rules<br>
Never commit directly into the master branch<br>
Master should always be working code<br>
Create feature branches not your name<br>
Pull master into your branch and fix conflicts in the branch<br>
Submit a pull request for your feature branch<br>
Guide lines<br>
Use good branch names no spaces, no capitals<br>
merge conflicts should be handled on the feature branch<br>
Communicate and isolate who is working in different sections of the code.</p>
